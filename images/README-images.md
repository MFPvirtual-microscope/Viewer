The images (graphics) used by the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope fall into two categories:
* graphics that are used by all implementations of the Virtual Microscope.  These graphics, mainly \*.png files, are used as icons and customized buttons, and can be found in this directory ([images](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/images)).
* graphics that are institution-specific and are unique to each specific implementation of the Virtual Microscope.  The "institution-specific" images for the generic ("Chipmunk") version of the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope (without any university affiliation) are found on this GitHub site in the [InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/InstSpcImgChip) directory.

In addition to the \*.png graphics used by all implementations of the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope Viewer (and back-up "generic" \*.jpg logos), the [images](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/images) directory also contains a "beep" ("toot") audible alert that, optionally (on Viewer's main menu, see "Settings" &rarr; "Turn ON warning box bell") accompanies some warning error messages.

The files in this directory should reside on the server in a directory named "images" that is at the same level as the directory containing the HTML & javascript files.
