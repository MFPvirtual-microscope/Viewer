This directory ([PHP_SQL](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/PHP_SQL)) contains three PHP files that the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope's Viewer uses to access the Virtual Microscope's SQL database when the user requests a new virtual slide.  These files should reside in a directory named "PHP_SQL" that is at the same level as the directory containing the HTML & javascript files.
