The Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope's Viewer (running on the client's computer) sequentially calls 3 PHP files (running on the server) to access the Virtual Microscope's SQL database when the user requests a new virtual slide.  These files should reside in a directory named "PHP_SQL" that is at the same level as the directory containing the HTML & javascript files.
