This directory ([HTMLclient](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/HTMLclient)) contains the HTML file ([Microscope.htm](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/blob/main/HTMLclient/Microscope.htm)) that is loaded/run by the user's internet browser when the user invokes the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope's Viewer.  This directory also contains the javascript and cascading stylesheet (CSS) files that are called by Microscope.htm.  Currently (May, 2022), there are 12 javascript files and two CSS files.  The \<script\> tags for the \*.js files are at the end of the HTML body, and the \<link\> tags for the stylesheets are in the HTML header.  It probably is best to keep all of these files together in the same directory on the server.
