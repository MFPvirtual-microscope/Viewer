//  NOTE:  In order to try to decrease the chance that I accidentally would use the same name for both a global variable
//		and a local variable, on 10/13/19, I replaced many of "sld"  prefixes on global variables with a "glb" prefix.
//		I did NOT change "sld" to "glb" for sldVw[], sldVwI, or for the slide-movement global variables.
//		In addition, while changing "sld" to "glb" prefixes, I also changed a few variable names to try to normalize
//		variable-naming orthography.

// sldVw{} is an array of sldView objects, each of which will hold the information for a specfic view plane
//	sldVis is a boolean indicating if style.display = "block" (true) or style.display = "hidden" (false)
//		At any given time, only one layer (at most) can be displayed (i.e. sldVisible == true)
//	sldWait was added 11/01/19.  It is a boolean which is set to true if the viewer is waiting for this view-plane to be
//		completely loaded.  At most, only one view-plane may have this variable set to "true", and this view-plane will
//		become the visible view-plane as soon as all the tiles for this plane are loaded.
//	f is the focal plane level; the maximum and minimum levels for slide will need to be stored in a different structure
//	z is the zoom-level; maximum zoom level (mimimum always is 0?) needs to be stored in a different structure
//	tiStrtXId is the ID-number of the current left-most tiles in image.  ("ti" is short for "tile")
//		In earlier versions, this was the global variable "sldColStartId".
//	tiMxNumX is the number of tiles currently in each row; this changes if the window is resized
//		In earlier versions, this was the global variable "sldNumInRow"
//	tiStrtYId is the ID-number of the current top row.
//		In earlier versions, this was the global variable "sldRowStartId"
//	tiMxNumY is the number of rows in the current image; this changes if teh window is resized
//		In earlier versions, this was the global variable "sldNumRows"
//	sldNode is the pointer to the node in the DOM containing the slideView plane
//	sldWaitArr is an array holding the list of img tiles that have NOT yet been loaded
//	"db" is short for "database"; 
//		Originally the "db" variables were going to be in a separate object, but there isn't an advantage to this
//	dbStrtXId is the ID-number of the first tile (of each row) in the whole slide database (for this z-level)
//		In earlier versions, this was "dataFirstJpegInRow"
//	dbMxNumX is the number of tiles in each row of the whole slide database for this z-level
//		In earlier versions, this was "dataMaxTileInRow"
//	dbTileOffX was removed from the sldView definition on 11/01/19.  It was the number of blank tiles (not counting those
//		included in dbStrtXid) at the beginning of each row (for this z-level) in the image database.  If libvips centers
//		the image pyramid, then this value always was 0.
//	dbPixelOffX was removed from the sldView definition on 11/01/19.  It was supposed to be the number of blank pixels
//		on the left side of first tile that contains the actual image of the slide.  For the images pyramided
//		using libvips with centering turned on, this number always was 0.
//	dbStrtYId is the ID-number of the first row of tiles in the whole slide database (for this z-level)
//		In earlier versions, this variable was "dataFirstRow"
//	dbMxNumY is the number of rows of tiles (at this z-level) in the whole slide database
//		In earlier versions, this variable was "dataMaxRows"
//	dbTileOffY was removed from the sldView definition on 11/01/19. It was the number of rows of blank tiles
//		(not counting those included in dbStrtYId) at the top of the whole slide (at this Z-level).  For the images
//		pyramided using libvips with centering turned on, this number always was 0.  
//	dbPixelOffY was removed from the sldView definition on 11/01/19.  It was supposed to be the number of blank pixels
//		on the top of tiles in the first row of tiles containing the actual image of the slide.  For the images pyramided
//		using libvips with centering turned on, this number always was 0.
//	dbRoot is the first part of the "src" string for the tile "img" elements
