In addition to generic images of buttons, etc, the Viewer uses images, such as university logos, that are unique to, and are involved in "branding", each specific implementation of the Multifocal-plane Virtual microsope.  The files in this directory ([InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/InstSpcImgChip)) contain these "institution-specific" images for the generic ("Chipmunk") version of the Viewer.  The number, names, and locations (on the server) of these images can vary between different implementations of the Viewer (at different institutions), and are specified in the javascript file, [jrscpInstSpcGlobal.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/blob/main/HTMLclient/jrscpInstSpcGlobal.js).
